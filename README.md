# `/api/jsonws extender`

Are you tired of the old api jsonws page? Take this new one.

* Compact design, fluid layout, method details with accordion
* JSON result sintax highlight
* Fast clipboard copy
* Recall for previous call parameters (using local storage)

Tested on Liferay 7.1 CE

[Download the bundle jar](https://github.com/baxtheman/api-jsonws-ext/releases/download/7.1.0.2/it.baxtheman.liferay.apijsonwsext-7.1.0.2.jar)
